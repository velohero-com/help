# Maps

You can choose between several map styles.

You can temporarily choose a different map style by clicking on the upper right icon in the map view or set a default style in the [settings](https://app.velohero.com/settings/display).

## Landscape (Default)

> The world is full of interesting features beyond roads and houses.
> The landscape layer emphasises natural features and is a perfect display for those interested in nature, the countryside, and life beyond the city.
