Average, xPower, NP and Smoothed Power When you are using a power meter you notice that power tends to move around a lot more than your heart rate. When you stop pedalling power drops to zero immediately. Your heart rate may take 30 seconds or so to recover. In truth, although the power meter says zero watts when you stop, the body's physiological response continues for roughly 30 seconds, as HR drops, breathing recovers and more complex energy system processes continue. This means that if we want to use power output as a measure of training stress we will also need to translate those simplistic power readings into something that reflects the associated physiological processes and their half-lives. This is what Dr. Andrew Coggan's Normalised Power, Dr. Phil Skiba's xPower and Velo Hero's Smoothed Power are doing; they \"smooth out\" the power data to reflect the underlying physiological processes.

The maximum file size is 16 megabytes (16,777,216 bytes). The duration of one workout may not exceed 72 hours (259,200 seconds). How are the weeks numbers calculated? Velo Hero calculates the weeks according to ISO. So the weeks can differ slightly from your usual format. Roughly summarised, this applies: The year has max. 53 weeks. The first week is 1 (not 0). The first week is, depending on your setting, the week with Monday or Sunday and more than four days. More details: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date How can I filter workouts? You can filter your workouts. Diary Analysis How do I optimize my recording? Set the recording interval as small as possible. If possible set the recording interval to one second. Disable on Garmin Fitness devices the \"Smart Recording\" and activate \"Every Second Recording\". Do not interrupt the recording and avoid gaps! If you are doing breaks, do not stop the recording. You're doing a workout and no walk in the park. Every second counts. Every second is important. If you're doing longer breaks finish the recording and start a new recording later. So you may see later that you have not done the distance straight. Disable on Garmin Fitness devices the \"Auto Pause\". SRM Power Control users: Hold PRO and SET simultaneously to start a new training file before you actually start your workout. You should really be ready to start and your Power Control should already be on your handlebars. After your workout press MODE longer than 10 seconds to manually enter Sleep Mode and deactivate the integrated motion sensor. Then download the training file with the SRM software. GPS and Smartphone users (Locus, Orux, ...): Set the GPS accuracy to at least 20 meters. Use if possible a speed sensor! If you follow these tips, \"duration in motion\", \"duration with cadence\" and \"duration with power\" can be calculated very accurately. NOTE: For Pro members only! How Velo Hero comes to its values? Here I would like to explain a few points regarding the calculations. Please also read how you can optimize your recording for the calculation. First things first: Velo Hero differs between duration and time in motion (moving time). Time in motion is the time with power, cadence or speed. The duration is the time between the start and the end of the recording. If possible averages are calculated with time in motion. But this is not always possible. For some file types, the totals and averages are taken from the file and are not recalculated. FIT File Type: .FIT Vendors: Garmin, SRM, SIGMA, Zwift, many more Distance: Read Ascent: Calculated Average Speed: Calculated Average Heart Rate: Calculated Average Cadence: Calculated Average Power: Calculated Calories: Read / Calculated (only with power) TCX File Type: .TCX Vendors: Garmin, Polar, many more Distance: Read Ascent: Calculated Average Speed: Read Average Heart Rate: Read Average Cadence: Read Average Power: Read Calories: Read GPX Many vendors offer a GPX export. Often there are differences in the structure of the file, so here we differentiate between the brands.

It is not distance divided by time. Average Power is calculated with time in motion. You therefore often get higher values than in other analyses. You get with this calculating a value that is similar to a race. Also, you can also better compare workouts with different pauses (traffic signals). Many other programs calculate average power with the duration. An extra explanation for the calculation of altitude can be found below. How do you calculate the altitude? All elevation data are filtered with a threshold of 3 meters. This means that only changes over 3 meters are considered for the calculation of the altitude. So you see a different value as on your device. You can better compare different recording from different devices with this calculation. Is there an API for developers? Yes :-) Send me an e-mail. I'll help you. How do I import the CSV export into LibreOffice? Pease read: https://help.libreoffice.org/Calc/Importing_and_Exporting_CSV_Files Specify the options to divide the text in the file into columns only with Semicolon. Why is speed and altitude missing in Garmin Connect Export? Since March 8, 2015 no velocity data and elevation data are included in the Garmin Connect export (TCX- and GPX-file). Why Garmin does not output the existing values, I can not say. To ensure that no detail is lost, the original file must be imported. This is the only way to ensure that the recorded values can be read correctly!

It is not distance divided by time. Average Power is calculated with time in motion. You therefore often get higher values than in other analyses.

There is no formal model or protocol for establishing it, most people use rules of thumb like FTP is 95% of 20 minute power, or they use the best power from a 40km TT. For example, if you were to ride a 40k time trial in 60 minutes at an average power of 270W, your FTP would be 270W. FTP = 20 min. peak power * 0.95 FTP is the keystone to training with power. It allows Velo Hero to determine how hard a ride is for you. You doing 280W might feel much different than someone less trained doing 280W and FTP allows us to gauge just how hard segments, rides, and even weeks or months of training were for you! You can enter your FTP under \"Body measurements\": https://app.velohero.com/body/edit/new - aware period! Tip: Save your first FTP entry far in the past. Automatic Threshold Calculation (FTP) In order to make it a little easier, there is an automatic threshold detection. The function you can activate in the settings (as default on): https://app.velohero.com/settings/display Workouts with more than 20 minutes power are considered for the calculation. Links YouTube: How To Calculate Your FTP (Functional Threshold Power) YouTube: What is FTP or Functional Threshold Power Smoothed Power When you ride with a power meter, you'll notice how your power jumps all over the place based on the terrain, grade, wind, and other factors. When you stop pedalling power drops to zero immediately. Your heart rate may take 30 seconds or so to recover. In truth, although the power meter says zero watts when you stop, the body's physiological response continues for roughly 30 seconds, as HR drops, breathing recovers and more complex energy system processes continue. This means that if we want to use power output as a measure of training stress we will also need to translate those simplistic power readings into something that reflects the associated physiological processes and their half-lives. This is what Dr. Andrew Coggan's Normalised Power, Dr. Phil Skiba's xPower and Velo Hero's Smoothed Power are doing; they \"smooth out\" the power data to reflect the underlying physiological processes. The underlying mathematics is slightly different. However, all formulas are much more accurately than just taking a simple average. TRaining IMPulse (TRIMP) TRIMP is a method for quantifying aerobic training load. It was originally defined as the product of training volume, measured in minutes, and training intensity, measured as average heart rate (beats per minute or bpm). For example, 50 min at 140 bpm: TRIMP = 50 \u00d7 140 = 7000 Velo Hero Level Velo Hero Level is the way at Velo Hero of showing how difficult a ride was as compared to your FTP. The Velo Hero Level is simply the ratio of the Smoothed Power to your Functional Threshold Power (FTP). For example, if your Smoothed Power is 180 W and your FTP at the time is 210 W, then the Velo Hero Level for that workout would be 0,86. Velo Hero Points Velo Hero Points are the Velo Hero Level multiplied by the duration. With Velo Hero Points you get an overall stress score. The more points you have collected the bigger impact it will have had and likely the more recovery we will need the day after. The guide below will tell you how long after a workout it will take you to fully recover: Less than 150 - low --> recovery generally complete by following day 150-300 - medium --> some residual fatigue may be present the next day, but gone by 2nd day 300-450 - high --> some residual fatigue may be present even after 2 days Greater than 450 - very high --> residual fatigue lasting several days likely Velocit\u00e0 Ascensionale Media (VAM) VAM is the abbreviation for the Italian term velocit\u00e0 ascensionale media, translated in English to mean \"average ascent speed\" or \"mean ascent velocity\", but usually referred to as VAM. The term, which was coined by Italian physician andcycling coach Michele Ferrari, is the speed of elevation gain. VAM is calculated the following way: VAM = (metres ascended x 60) / Minutes it took to ascend Velo Hero calculates VAM slightly differently: VAM = (metres ascended x 60) / Total duration Velo Hero unfortunately does not have the duration of the ascend, so the total duration is taken. This is of course not the \"real\" VAM but also offers a good guideline. Examples: 1800+: Lance Armstrong during the EPO era. 1650-1800: Top 10 / Tour de France GC or mountain stage winner. 1450-1650: Top 20 / Tour de France GC; top 20 on tough mountain stage. 1300-1450: Finishing Tour de France mountain stages in peloton 1100-1300: The Autobus Crew Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAM_(bicycling)","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"glossary.html#glossary","text":"","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"glossary.html#functional-threshold-power-ftp","text":"Your Functional Threshold Power (FTP) is the maximum average power that you can hold for one continuous hour.
